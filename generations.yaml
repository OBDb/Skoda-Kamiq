    description: "The Škoda Kamiq is the Czech brand's entry into the subcompact crossover SUV segment, positioned as the smallest SUV in Škoda's lineup below the Karoq and Kodiaq. Built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB A0 platform shared with models like the Volkswagen T-Cross, SEAT Arona, and Škoda Scala, the Kamiq combines city-friendly dimensions with an elevated driving position and crossover styling. The name 'Kamiq' comes from the language of the Inuit people of northern Canada and Greenland, meaning 'something that fits perfectly.' Measuring approximately 4.24 meters in length, the Kamiq is designed to appeal to urban dwellers seeking practicality and versatility without excessive exterior dimensions. The exterior design features Škoda's contemporary styling language with split headlight design (a first for a European Škoda model), where LED daytime running lights are positioned above the main headlight units, creating a distinctive front-end appearance. Engine options include 1.0 TSI three-cylinder and 1.5 TSI four-cylinder gasoline engines, plus a 1.6 TDI diesel in some markets, with power outputs ranging from 95 to 150 horsepower. Transmission options include five and six-speed manuals and a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic depending on engine selection. Unlike some competitors, the Kamiq is exclusively front-wheel drive across all variants, focusing on on-road dynamics rather than off-road capability. The interior showcases Škoda's modern design approach with a free-standing infotainment screen (up to 9.2 inches), optional 10.25-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument display, and distinctive materials and textures. Consistent with Škoda's 'Simply Clever' philosophy, the Kamiq features numerous practical touches including an umbrella in the driver's door, an ice scraper in the fuel filler cap, and a removable LED flashlight in the cargo area. Despite its compact exterior dimensions, the Kamiq offers generous interior space with 400 liters of cargo capacity, expanding to 1,395 liters with the rear seats folded—figures that compare favorably with many larger vehicles. The Kamiq has been positioned to appeal to young families and urban professionals looking for a practical, feature-rich vehicle with SUV styling cues but the manageable dimensions and running costs of a smaller car."
